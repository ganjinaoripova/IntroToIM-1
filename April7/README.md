## Pop Balloons!

### Description
In times of uncertainty and trouble, I wanted to create a light-hearted/cheerful card with a note that would hopefully make people smile. Hence came my idea to display the Winnie the Pooh quote "nobody can be uncheered with a balloon" along with balloons going up in the sky. The balloons can be popped by placing the mouse on them for a certain amount of time until. This is demonstrated in the above video.
In accordance to the instructions for this assignment to incorporate object-oriented programming, I created two classes, "balloon" and "time". The "balloons" class was used to give features to the balloons being displayed, and the "time" class was to control the number of balloons coming up at once.
