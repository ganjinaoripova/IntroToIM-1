## Self-Portrait

### Description
My self-portrait, although not interactive by itself, changes the color of the t-shirt whenever the program is run again. The entire code is in the setup, so the display doesn't change while the program is running. It was honestly pretty difficult to create a self portrait by only using code and being limited to curves and shapes.
